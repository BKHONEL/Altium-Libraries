# VariantFilter
This script creates a filter expression to select components that are fitted in a variant. The filter expression is placed in the PCB Filter panel and applied. This can then be used to create variant component classes in the PCB panel.

*Based on PrintAllVariants script by Petar Perisin*


## Usage
Choose a variant from the form to select all fitted, fitted original, fitted alternate or not fitted components on a PCB.
