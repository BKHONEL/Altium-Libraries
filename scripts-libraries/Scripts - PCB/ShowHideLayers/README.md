# ShowHideLayers
This scripts can be used to show or hide layers.

It shows all layers in a form and by clicking you turn them on or off. This is easier to use than "Board Layers and colors" dialog because:
- View is automatically updated and user can see the view when clicking on checkboxes, so if something also is in a way it can be turned off
- This is not dialog so user can control PCB while the form is shown.


## Known limitations
It supports "only" up to 32 signal layers. If you need more, ask.
