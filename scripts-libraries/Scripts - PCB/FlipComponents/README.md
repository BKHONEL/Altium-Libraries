# FlipComponents
This script works in 2 ways:
- If there are selected objects, it flips selected components to the opposite side of the board.
- If there are no selected objects it asks user to click on components, and it flips them.

Script uses smart way to figure out weather component is vertical or horizontal, and it flips according to this info. This means that for simple components like resistors pads will not change position, and even if flipped they will be flipped in a smart way.
