# OpenLib
Opens the library of the selected component either in Schematic, PCB or SchLib environment.
* PCB:    Open PCBLib and show footprint
* Sch:    Open SchLib and show component
* SchLib: Show selector for currently present footprints and open PCBLib and footprint for selection


## Usage
Run the OpenLib procedure while the component is selected.


## Known limitation
Currently only tested with IntLibs. Might have issues with SVNLibs, DBLibs and SVNDBlibs as well as Vault components.\
Is a bit verbose on the messages panel, to be adjustable in future releases.
