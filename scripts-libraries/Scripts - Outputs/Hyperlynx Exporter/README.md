# Hyperlynx_Exporter
This scripts can be used to export better *.hyp file from Altium.

Hyperlynx is a program used for signal&power integrity simulation from Mentor Graphics.

Altium has built-in Hyperlynx exporter, but it does not export any copper areas such as polygons, regions, split planes or fills.\
This script uses Altium's built-in hyp exporter at the beginning, and adds new information to it about copper area primitives mentioned above.
