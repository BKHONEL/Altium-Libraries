# LRJustify
This script is intended for use in the Schematic editor.


## Usage
Select some text, activate the script, and it will swap it from left justification to right justification.

It is best used when assigned to a shortcut key.\
Assign it first to a button/icon:

`Process: ScriptingSystem:RunScriptFile`

`Parameters: Filename = <FULL FILE PATH HERE> | Procname = LRJustify`

then assign it a shortcut key.
