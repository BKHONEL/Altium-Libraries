This Script saves variant information to CSV file, which can then be easily opened in excel.

File contains component physical designators in rows and variant names in columns. cells in between contain "Fitted" or "Not Fitted" value, depending on weather component is in variant or not.\
After you open this file in excel, you can then merge it with BOM, and BOM will then contain info about all variants.
