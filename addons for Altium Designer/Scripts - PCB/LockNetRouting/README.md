# LockNetRouting
This script locks/unlocks whole track which belongs to user selected track.


## Usage
Lock or unlock function is selected by choosing startup procedure.\
You can lock/unlock multiple nets by clicking one by one. Script is terminated by right click during selection or by selecting No Net track.

It is good to activate "Protect Locked Objects" in DXP->Preferences->PCB editor->General to get real protection for routing.

Customization can by done by direct edditing of constants inside the source code.
