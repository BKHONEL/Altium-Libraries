This scripts can be used to show or hide layers.

It shows all layers in a form and by clicking you turn them on or off. This is easier to use than "Board Layers and colors" dialog because:
- View is automativally updated and user can see the view when clicking on checkboxes, so if something also is in a way it can be turned off
- This is not dialog so user can control PCB while the form is shown.

This one was made from scratch, because I wanted to remove tabs from "ShowHideLayers" script. It shows layers in blocks that can be shown or hidden. It has couple of more enhancements than "ShowHidelayers" script:
- Support for all 48 copper layers (you will never manage to fit then on screen).
- You can disable group of layers by clicking in the upper right corner of the group. If you disable the group you still see "All" and "Visible" checkboxes.
- "Visible" checkbox allows you to disable the group from view without changing checkbox values.
- Click on Layer Color makes that Layer Current Layer.
