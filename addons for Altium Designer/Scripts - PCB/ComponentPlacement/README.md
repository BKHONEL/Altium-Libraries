# ComponentPlacement
This scripts is made to ease component placement. It allows user to easily copy destination component placement based on their relative placement of orientational component (I know this does not explain anything, but read on).


## Usage
This script asks user to click on components a lot.\
First he needs to select source orientational component and destination orientational component. This two components are main ones, since all other component placement will be based on this two.\
After this user needs to click on source component, and after that on destination component. Destination component placement will be changed so that relative placement of source component and source orientational component = relative placement of destination component and destination orientational component.
